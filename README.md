# Public Transport Feedback System

## Project Overview

The Public Transport Feedback System is a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) API designed to allow passengers to submit feedback about their travel experiences on various modes of public transport, including buses, trains, and ferries. Administrators can view, manage, and categorize this feedback, ensuring that passengers' concerns and suggestions are addressed effectively.
